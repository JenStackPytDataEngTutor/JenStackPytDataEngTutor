"""Question 10:
Write a program which takes 2 digits, X,Y as input and generates a 2-dimensional array.
The element value in the i-th row and j-th column of the array should be i*j.
Note: i=0,1.., X-1; j=0,1,i-Y-1.
Example
Suppose the following inputs are given to the program:
3,5
Then, the output of the program should be:
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 2, 3, 4], [0, 2, 4, 6, 8]]

Hints:
Note: In case of input data being supplied to the question,
it should be assumed to be a console input in a comma-separated form.

Solution:
input_str = input("Enter data:")
dimensions=[int(x) for x in input_str.split(',')]
rowNum=dimensions[0]
colNum=dimensions[1]
# multilist = [[0 for col in range(colNum)] for row in range(rowNum)]
#
# for row in range(rowNum):
#     for col in range(colNum):
#         multilist[row][col]= row*col

multilist = [[row*col for col in range(colNum)] for row in range(rowNum)]

print(multilist)

Question 11:
Write a program that accepts a comma separated sequence of words as input and prints the words in a comma-separated sequence after sorting them alphabetically.
Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:
without,hello,bag,world
Then, the output should be:
bag,hello,without,world

Hints:
In case of input data being supplied to the question, it should be assumed to be a console input.

Solution:
items=[x for x in input().split(',')]
items.sort()
print(','.join(items))

Question 12
Write a program that accepts sequence of lines as input and prints the lines after making all characters in the sentence capitalized.
Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:
Hello world
Practice makes perfect
Then, the output should be:
HELLO WORLD
PRACTICE MAKES PERFECT

Hints:
In case of input data being supplied to the question, it should be assumed to be a console input.

Solution:
lines = []
while True:
    s = input()
    if s:
        lines.append(s.upper())
    else:
        break;

for sentence in lines:
    print(sentence)

Question 13
Write a program that accepts a sequence of whitespace separated words as input and prints the words after removing all duplicate words and sorting them alphanumerically.
Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:
hello world and practice makes perfect and hello world again
Then, the output should be:
again and hello makes perfect practice world

Hints:
In case of input data being supplied to the question, it should be assumed to be a console input.
We use set container to remove duplicated data automatically and then use sorted() to sort the data.

Solution:
s = input()
words = [word for word in s.split(" ")]
print(" ".join(sorted(list(set(words)))))

Question 14
Write a program, which will find all such numbers between 1000 and 3000 (both included) such that each digit of the number is an even number.
The numbers obtained should be printed in a comma-separated sequence on a single line.

Hints:
In case of input data being supplied to the question, it should be assumed to be a console input.

Solution:
values = []
for i in range(1000, 3001):
    s = str(i)
    if (int(s[0])%2==0) and (int(s[1])%2==0) and (int(s[2])%2==0) and (int(s[3])%2==0):
        values.append(s)
print(",".join(values))

Question 15:
Write a program that accepts a sentence and calculate the number of letters and digits.
Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:
hello world! 123
Then, the output should be:
LETTERS 10
DIGITS 3

Hints:
In case of input data being supplied to the question, it should be assumed to be a console input.

Solution:
s = input()
d={"DIGITS":0, "LETTERS":0}
for c in s:
    if c.isdigit():
        d["DIGITS"]+=1
    elif c.isalpha():
        d["LETTERS"]+=1
    else:
        pass
print("LETTERS", d["LETTERS"])
print("DIGITS", d["DIGITS"])
